# Push_swap

#### Summary :

<p> This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various
types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an
optimized data sorting. </p>

### The Rules : 

<h1>Stack Sorting Algorithm</h1>

<p>You have 2 stacks named <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>At the beginning:
    <ul>
      <li>The stack <em>a</em> contains a random amount of negative and/or positive numbers which cannot be duplicated.</li>
      <li>The stack <em>b</em> is empty.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The goal is to sort in ascending order numbers into stack <em>a</em>. To do so you have the following operations at your disposal:</li>
</ul>
